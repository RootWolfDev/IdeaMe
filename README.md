# 1-the idea of the Project:
Some may see financial support as the only way to develop content or a project, but no one has considered developing the project through diverse ideas and creative minds, which may sometimes be hidden behind a single, well-thought-out mind.
# 2-Project content:
It's very easy. All you have to do is go to the website and write down whatever comes to mind, whether it's advice, ideas, or anything else that might be helpful.
# 3-How was it programmed ?
This project was created using the well-known web page language [HTML](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language).
I also used the [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) service.
